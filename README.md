# 🎮 GameBoy Emulator: RFPO-GB ( 👷🏼 Work in Progress 🔧 )

## 🚀 Project Overview: Why Build an Emulator?

This project is an emulator for the original GameBoy built from scratch in modern C++.

The goal of this exercise is deepen my low-level systems programming. It requires translating complex hardware documentation into functioning, reliable and optimized software. This project was undertaken to demonstrate proficiency in:

  - System Architecture: Deep understanding of CPU instruction sets, memory mapping, and I/O registers.

  - Performance Engineering: Writing highly optimized C++ code to handle the heavy computational load of emulation while maintaining synchronization across different hardware components.

- Complex State Machines: Implementing the Picture Processing Unit (PPU) and other time-sensitive hardware logic.

The goal was not just to run games, but most importantly to understand the finite state machine of the hardware well enough to pass common public emulator test ROMs.
